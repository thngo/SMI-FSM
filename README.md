# SMI-FSM

Single Molecule Imaging – Fluorescent Speckle Microscopy (SMI-FSM) analysis

SMI-FSM is a software (written in MATLAB) for the analysis of simultaneous two-color imaging data of plasma membrane proteins (via SMI) and cortical actin (via FSM). In brief, it is designed to:

1. Extract dynamic properties of single molecule tracks and actin speckle tracks.

2. Integrate and quantitatively analyze the relationships between the single molecule and actin speckle properties.
